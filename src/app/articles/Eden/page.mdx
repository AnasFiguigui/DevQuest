  ============================================
  ARTICLE TEMPLATE - HOW TO USE
  ============================================
  
  1. Duplicate this folder and rename it (e.g., "my-new-article")
  2. Update the article metadata above (author, date, title, description)
  3. Replace this content with your article content
  4. Use the components shown below for rich content
  
  Available components:
  - ImageLightbox: Clickable image that opens in a modal
  - ArticleVideo: Video player with optional controls
  - Carousel3D: 3D image carousel
  - Standard markdown (headers, lists, code blocks, etc.)
*/}

This is the introduction paragraph of your article. Write about your journey, 
experience, or whatever topic you want to cover. **Bold text** and *italic text* 
work as expected in markdown.

## Section Header

Use `##` for main sections and `###` for subsections. This helps organize your 
content and creates a clear hierarchy.

### Clickable Images

Use `ImageLightbox` for images that users can click to view in full size:

<ImageLightbox 
  src="/images/photos/Projects/Eden/image-1.avif" 
  alt="Description of the image for accessibility"
  caption="Optional caption that appears below the image"
/>

### Videos

Use `ArticleVideo` to embed videos:

<ArticleVideo 
  src="/images/photos/image-1.webm"
  caption="Demo video showing the feature in action"
  autoPlay={true}
  loop={true}
  muted={true}
  controls={false}
/>

{/* For videos with user controls: */}
{/* 
<ArticleVideo 
  src="/path/to/video.mp4"
  caption="Video with controls"
  autoPlay={false}
  loop={false}
  muted={false}
  controls={true}
/>
*/}

### 3D Carousel

Use `Carousel3D` to showcase multiple images in an interactive carousel:

<Carousel3D 
  images={[
    '/images/photos/FavGames/minecraft.avif',
    '/images/photos/FavGames/witcher3.avif',
    '/images/photos/FavGames/diablo4.avif',
    '/images/photos/FavGames/hades2.avif',
    '/images/photos/FavGames/poe.avif',
  ]}
  autoPlay={true}
  autoPlaySpeed={50}
  aspectRatio="3/4"
/>

### Links

Regular markdown links work normally:
- [Internal link to about page](/about)
- [External link to GitHub](https://github.com/AnasFiguigui)

External links automatically open in a new tab.

### Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello from the article!')
}
```

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

### Lists

**Unordered list:**
- First item
- Second item
- Third item with nested items
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2

**Ordered list:**
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. Use it to highlight important quotes or key takeaways 
> from your article.

### Inline Code

Use backticks for `inline code` like variable names or short commands.

## Technical Details

When writing about technical topics, you can organize information in clear sections:

- **Technology**: List the technologies used
- **Platform**: Web, mobile, etc.
- **Duration**: How long the project took

## Conclusion

Wrap up your article with final thoughts, lessons learned, or a call to action 
for readers.
