My first video game was built in **four intense days**.

During the **Morocco 2100** game jam, organized by ISART Digital as part of the Video Game Creator program, 55 participants came together in Rabat to imagine the future of Morocco through interactive experiences.

And somehow… we shipped a playable game.

## The Challenge

From September 29 to October 2, teams from:

- ISMAC  
- Université Internationale de Rabat  
- Université Ibn Tofaïl  

worked under one theme:

> **“Morocco 2100”**

The goal wasn’t perfection.  
It was to learn, collaborate, and create something playable — fast.

## Our Process

We kept it simple:

1. Define one strong core mechanic  
2. Build a small vertical slice  
3. Playtest constantly  
4. Polish only what matters  

Game jams teach you something very quickly:

Scope is everything.

Instead of trying to build a big game, we focused on making one mechanic feel good. That decision saved us.

## What I Learned

- Team communication is more important than technical perfection  
- A finished small game > an ambitious unfinished one  
- Fast iteration beats long planning  
- Pressure reveals your strengths and weaknesses  

Seeing people play something we built in less than a week was surreal.

## Why It Matters

This jam wasn’t just an event.

It was the moment I realized I could take an idea, collaborate with a team, and turn it into a **real, playable experience** under tight constraints.

It gave me confidence.

And it made me hungry to build more.
