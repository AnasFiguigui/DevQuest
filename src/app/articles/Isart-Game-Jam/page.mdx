During the **Morocco 2100** game jam, organized by ISART Digital as part of the Video Game Creator program, 55 participants came together in Rabat to imagine the future of Morocco through interactive experiences.

## The Challenge

From September 29 to October 2, teams from:

- ISMAC  
- Université Internationale de Rabat  
- Université Ibn Tofaïl  

The goal wasn’t perfection.  
It was to learn, collaborate, and create something playable — fast.

## Our Process

We kept it simple:

1. Define one strong core mechanic  
2. Build a small vertical slice  
3. Playtest constantly  
4. Polish only what matters  

Game jams teach you something very quickly:

Scope is everything.

Instead of trying to build a big game, we focused on making one mechanic feel good. That decision saved us.

## What I Learned & Why It Matters

- Team communication is more important than technical perfection  
- A finished small game > an ambitious unfinished one  
- Fast iteration beats long planning  

It was the moment I realized I could take an idea, collaborate with a team, and turn it into a **real, playable experience** under tight constraints.
