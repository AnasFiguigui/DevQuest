This year has been a turning point in my journey as a game developer.  
From daily prototyping sessions to pitching at the **Moroccan Gaming Expo 2025**, and finally graduating from the **Video Game Creator (VGC) program**, every step shaped how I think about building games.

This isn’t just a recap — it’s a reflection on growth, discipline, and community.

## The Power of Dailies

One of the most impactful habits I developed during the program was committing to **daily progress**.

A “daily” wasn’t just about writing code. It meant:

- Testing a gameplay idea  
- Iterating on mechanics  
- Improving player feedback  
- Documenting design decisions  
- Sharing progress with the team  

Small improvements compound fast. A tweak in movement feel. A slight timing adjustment. A better sound cue.

Over time, these tiny refinements turned rough prototypes into polished experiences.

> Consistency beats intensity in game development.

## Moroccan Gaming Expo 2025 — A Defining Moment

A month later, the energy of **MGE 2025 in Rabat** still resonates with me.

Participating as part of the VGC program and representing my studio, **ExpertLevel Studio**, was a huge milestone.

### What made it unforgettable:

- Presenting our projects and receiving direct player feedback  
- Pitching in front of a live audience — intense but incredibly rewarding  
- Attending the *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33* conference  
- Meeting inspiring industry professionals

The strongest takeaway wasn’t just exposure — it was realizing how fast Morocco’s gaming ecosystem is evolving.  
Through collaboration between **MJCC, Institut Français, ISART Digital**, and many partners, real opportunities are being built for young creators.

And being part of that movement felt powerful.

## Graduation — More Than a Certificate

After nine months of training, teamwork, late builds, and playtests…  
we officially completed the **Video Game Creator 2025 program**.

Receiving the certificate was meaningful — but what truly mattered was everything behind it:

- Learning how to design a game from concept to production  
- Understanding project management in real conditions  
- Collaborating across disciplines  
- Pitching and presenting professionally  

I’m deeply grateful to:

- Ambassade de France au Maroc  
- MJCC  
- ISART Digital  
- Université Internationale de Rabat  
- ISMAC  
- All mentors, coordinators, and teachers  

And especially my classmates — the creativity, teamwork, and energy we shared made this journey unforgettable.

## What This Year Taught Me

1. **Discipline creates freedom.**  
   Structured workflows allow creativity to thrive.

2. **Community accelerates growth.**  
   Feedback from peers and professionals shortens learning curves dramatically.

3. **Shipping matters more than perfection.**  
   A playable prototype teaches more than a perfect idea.

4. **Game development is human.**  
   Behind every build are conversations, debates, laughs, and shared pressure.

## Technical Evolution

During the program, I strengthened:

- **Gameplay systems implementation**
- **Rapid prototyping workflows**
- **Production pipelines**
- **Pitch structuring & presentation clarity**
- **Team coordination in milestone-based development**

The shift wasn’t just technical — it was mental.  
I started thinking less like “someone making a game” and more like a **developer building production-ready systems**.

---

## Looking Forward

This graduation doesn’t feel like an ending.

It feels like a launchpad.

New projects.  
Stronger vision.  
Bigger ambition.

The journey continues — and now I build with more clarity, confidence, and purpose.
