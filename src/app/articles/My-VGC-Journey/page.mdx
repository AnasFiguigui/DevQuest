This year has been a turning point in my journey as a game developer.  
From daily prototyping sessions to pitching at the **Moroccan Gaming Expo 2025**, and finally graduating from the **Video Game Creator (VGC) program**, every step shaped how I think about building games.

---

## How It Started

At the beginning of the program, everything felt overwhelming.

- New tools.
- New teammates.
- Real deadlines.

Instead of aiming for something huge, we started small, our very first arcade-style game.

The objective was simple:
Create a complete, playable experience from start to finish.

It wasn’t just a prototype anymore, It was a finished game.

## Moroccan Gaming Expo 2025 — A Defining Moment

Five months later, the energy of **MGE 2025 in Rabat** still resonates with me.

Participating as part of the VGC program and representing our game.

### What made it unforgettable:

- Presenting our projects and receiving direct player feedback  
- Pitching in front of a live audience, intense but incredibly rewarding  
- Attending the *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33* conference  
- Meeting inspiring industry professionals

The strongest takeaway wasn’t just exposure, it was realizing how fast Morocco’s gaming ecosystem is evolving.  
Through collaboration between **MJCC, Institut Français, ISART Digital**, and many partners, real opportunities are being built for young creators.

## Graduation

After ten months of training, teamwork, late builds, and playtests…  
we officially completed the **Video Game Creator 2025 program**.

Receiving the certificate was meaningful — but what truly mattered was everything behind it:

- Learning how to design a game from concept to production  
- Understanding project management in real conditions  
- Collaborating across disciplines  
- Pitching and presenting professionally  

I’m deeply grateful to:

- MJCC
- ISART Digital 
- Ambassade de France au Maroc  
- Université Internationale de Rabat
- All mentors, coordinators, and teachers  

And especially my classmates, the creativity, teamwork, and energy we shared made this journey unforgettable ❤️.
