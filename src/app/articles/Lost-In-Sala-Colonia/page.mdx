**Lost In SalaColonia** — from walking through ancient ruins with a notebook in hand, to presenting a playable experience in front of industry professionals at **ISART Talents**.

---

## The Beginning — Visiting Chellah

Before writing a single line of code, we visited **Chellah**.
Walking through the ruins changed everything.

The textures of the stone, the atmosphere, the silence broken by wind and birds — it wasn’t just historical, it was emotional. We didn’t want to “make a game about ruins.”  
We wanted to capture the *feeling* of being there.

    { src: "/images/photos/Articles/LISC/image-5.avif", alt: "Second image" }
  ]}

During that visit, we asked ourselves:

- What stories could this place inspire?
- How do we translate atmosphere into mechanics?

That day shaped the identity of Lost In SalaColonia.

## From Inspiration to Prototype

Once we had a direction, we moved into rapid prototyping.

  ]}

At first, it was overpowered. Then too limited. After several iterations, we tuned it to feel tactical and intentional rather than chaotic.

That balance made exploration dynamic without breaking level design.

---

## Teamwork & Production Structure

This project truly taught us what production means.

We organized ourselves with:

- Clear role distribution  
- Weekly milestones  
- Short daily check-ins  
- Shared documentation for scope decisions  

Instead of working in isolation, we kept constant communication between design, programming, and art.

    { src: "/images/photos/Articles/LISC/image-14.avif", alt: "Gameplay iteration phase" }

The biggest lesson?  
Miscommunication costs more time than technical challenges.

When designers and programmers align early, iteration becomes smooth.

## Preparing for ISART Talents

After four months of learning and development, the moment came to present our project at **ISART Talents**.

<ImageRow

    { src: "/images/photos/Articles/LISC/image-12.avif", alt: "Second image" }
  ]}
  alt="Team visiting Chellah for inspiration"
/>

The event brought together:

- UIR students
- Video game professionals  
- Representatives from the French Embassy in Morocco
- Other institutional partners  

We weren’t just showing a project. We were presenting months of growth.

## What Lost In SalaColonia Taught Me

- Inspiration should come from real places and emotions.
- Strong prototypes beat ambitious unfinished systems.
- Playtesting reveals truths you can’t see yourself.
- Team structure is as important as technical skill.
- Presentation skills are part of being a game developer.

This project transformed how I approach design.  
I stopped thinking only in features and started thinking in **player experience flows**.

---

## Technical Growth

During the development of Lost In SalaColonia, I strengthened:

- Gameplay system implementation  
- Iterative level design workflows  
- Debugging and optimization  
- Cross-discipline collaboration  
- Vertical slice production planning  

More than anything, I learned how to balance creativity with constraints.

## Final Thoughts

From Chellah’s ancient walls to the spotlight of ISART Talents, Lost In SalaColonia represents a key milestone in my development journey.

It’s proof that great projects require structure, and meaningful games are built by teams who communicate, iterate, and believe in their vision.
