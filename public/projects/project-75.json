  "longDescription": "<p>Set in Morocco, 2100, Project 75 is a fast-paced mini-game collection developed during a game jam. The player takes on the unusual role of a mischievous devil whose only way to progress is by interfering, sabotaging, and influencing events across a series of chaotic micro-challenges. <br><br> Each mini-game introduces a new mechanic and scenario, keeping the experience unpredictable and energetic. As the player advances, the visual style evolves starting with rough, sketch-like scenes that gradually transform to reflect a shifting vision of Morocco’s future.</p>",
